# Mixed-integer-programming
This repository presents some applications of mixed integer programming, which is a way to model and solve optimization problems.
For more information about MIP, check out the Wikipedia page : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_programming

MIP has been around for a long time, but its range of use has been growing a lot over the years : indeed, Moore's law along with (very significant) algorithmic improvements has lead to a tremendous speed-up of MIP solving, making it probably one of the most useful tools for solving NP-complete and NP-hard problems.

One application that a lot of people don't know about is the exact solving of the traveling salesman problem (TSP), which MIP makes possible one instances of more than 100 nodes, while a less abstract bruteforce method can only solve this problem up to 10 to 15 nodes. You can already check out the 'TSP MIP solving' file here to see it.
